sag
===

A POC CLI to create animated SVGs from directory of frames. 

The generated images work very similar to GIFs - but only better.

- They have better colour spectrum
- Are on the whole lower file size when using compressed JPGs
- When using transparent PNGs as the frames - they are truly transparent with no matte like GIFs


#### Getting Started
===

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```


Find out the options
```
./sag --help
```


Make some frames, and get going with your images.
